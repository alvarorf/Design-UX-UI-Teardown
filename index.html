        <div>Vasilis van Gemert is a lecturer at the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam where he teaches the next generation 
        of digital designers how to design for the web — technically, aesthetically, and with accessibility in mind. 
        Vasilis recently completed a Design Research Master program and, to raise awareness for creating truly inclusive websites, 
        he designed tailor-made sites for and with people with real disabilities for his thesis. He shares his knowledge about web
        design and development on his blog, in workshops, at conferences, and giving lectures at schools and meetups. 
        Thank you for everything you do for the community, dear Vasilis!
